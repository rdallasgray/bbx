Backbox (bbx) is a set of extensions to the Zend Framework which I developed to allow me to manage various websites using https://github.com/rdallasgray/bxs.

It needs a good cleanup, and proper testing and documentation, so at present I'm not providing full instructions here on how to use it.

As well as Active Record-like database access, it provides a RESTful controller infrastructure, image manipulation via Imagick or MagickWand, and simplification of the use of various Zend Framework functionalities (search, caching, S3 storage, etc.).

If you're interested in knowing more about the project, contact me via GitHub.
